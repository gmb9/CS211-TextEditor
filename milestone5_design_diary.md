This milestone was the most conceptually difficult for me thus far, but by the end I feel that I understand the Trie datastructure much better, and am glad I was able to get it somewhat finished. I say somewhat because, as it currently stands, my code has working functions that allow for auto completion of words using the text file provided, but due to my lack of knowledge of the pdcurses library, I don't know how to convert what I have into something that will work with my text editor.

It was very difficult finding time to work on the project with a midterm in this class, a midterm in my stats class, and the extended power outages, but having worked over the weekend and having spent some time with the tutors I am very glad that I was able to solve the data structure part of the problem.

I found that of the people I talked to about this assignment, most were able to figure out the data structure portion and work through things similar to how we solved the midterm questions, but implimenting things with pdcurses is when the most problems began to arise. 

Overall, this assignment has been interesting and challenging, but I think that previous class structures have been more beneficial for improving my knowledge of C++ and the data structures used in it. I would say that pdcurses has been more of a burden, and seems to bring a part of me away from learning the data structures and forces me to learn a new library that is very uncommon.
