Milestone 7 was fairly simple, with the biggest problem I faced being figuring out how to print my sorted vector to the screen. With the provided sorting algorithms, it was really just a matter of slightly modifying each algorithm to make it fit my code, then adding a way to clear the screen and replace text with the sorted list.

I added 4 different key binds to do each respective sort that go as follows:

ALT_Z -> Insertion Sort
ALT_X -> Selection Sort
ALT_C -> Bubble Sort
ALT_V -> Quick Sort

You can use one, delete it, and try another, but the current problem with it is that it doesn't delete properly. The cursor doesn't move in regard to what's being inputted to the screen correctly, thus leaving behind previous sorts unless written over in a following sort.

Aside from that however, each sorting algorithm works as expected. There's no way in my code to compare them which makes it difficult to see much of a difference between algorithms, especially with such small test cases. As far as understanding the sorting algorithms go, everything other than quick sort has been conceptually simple to grasp, which I think was to be expected. Hopefully, with the coming final, studying with other people and going over each of these different sorting algorithms will reinforce things a little, and possibly help me to fully understand quicksort.

Overall, this project was an interesting experience. There were definite times when I didn't want or know how to move forward with things, and unfortunately I never really came up with a product I was excited about. Plus, hearing you say that data structures is the last programmatical class we'll most likely take is disappointing, as I feel I have a lot to learn when it comes to programming in general, and really enjoy a structured learning experience.
