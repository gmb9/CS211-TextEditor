This milestone was tougher than initially expected, and I'm not super proud of what I have to offer. I find with each milestone I feel further and further behind, and am undoubtedly digging myself deeper and deeper with how messy my code has been thus far. It works to an extent, but scrolling and data going off the viewable screen are two big things I'm not sure what to do about.

I spent a lot of time working to try to not only figure out how I did scrolling before, but how I could translate it to what I'm trying to do now. I was never able to show anything for my efforts, and I am definitely disappointed with the outcome this week. I find it hard to feel proud of what I've done so far, as I feel a lot of it has come from asking for help and not really understanding the answer.

Currently, my code can scroll through a designated file, allow the user to type whatever he/she wants to the screen, and save anything written on the screen to a previously created file. If anything overflows the bound of the screen it is not saved, and it cannot be scrolled to. Currently I am only able to open the single designated file I mentioned previously, but I feel that opening a second file is a task I am comfortable figuring out.

So far in this class, I have found it difficult to mash what I already know, what I'm currently learning in class, and what I'm currently learning outside of class together to make something functional. The library we're using is unfamiliar to me, which adds another level of difficulty that I didn't expect at first when beginning this assignment.
