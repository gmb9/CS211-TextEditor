This is the most confident I've felt about a milestone in a while, and I'm really happy with my result. While I didn't get the decompression piece working, I did get the main assignment done and working nicely.

The biggest problems I ran into were very easy to solve, and were really just either simple mistakes or small overlooks in how my vectors and unordered maps were built. One main issue that I had trouble with was one word per document, the last word, getting random dead space characters added to the end of it, causing both the frequency count and the binary output to be wonky. The fix was simple though, and required only checking to make sure that the word being built wasn't adding that dead space to the end of it.

I am happy with how much of this milestone I did on my own, as well as with how I was able to take what I had used on the midterm and translate it to help me here, that being the code to separate my file into words, give them frequencies, and sort them based on said frequencies. While this exact code wasn't used on the midterm exam, I found similarities between a few of the questions and was able to translate what I had previously written and make it work with this milestone.

The coming milestone on the surface level seems very straight forward, and I am excited to see what I can get done.
